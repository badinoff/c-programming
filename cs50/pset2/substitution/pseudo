I. main function should expect an argument which will be the cipher key - 26 alhpa characters of either case. main(argc, string argv[])

II. first the program should ensure there are only two arguments passed - program name and the cipher key - if (argc != 2)
    a. if two arguments are passed - continue executing next steps
    b. if any other number of arguments passed - print a usage message
    c. strlen to make sure the key is 26 characters long.

III.next the program should validate the key to ensure that it is
    a. characters do not repeat ?
    b. all characters are alpha (no numbers) (if !isdigit(argv[1][i]) {printf("usage message" return 1)})

i am guessing that I would need to convert string to chr to be able to iterate through each character and put characters into an array so that i can use each to manipulate the plain text

to do this i might need to employ one or several if statements (?) and a loop to iterate through each character to validate it.

IV. once the cipher is validated, i need to collect user input (plain text)
    a. again, guessing I would need to convert string to chr
    b. check each character's case and return enciphered value in the corresponding case
    c. introduce logic to ignore numeric characters and leave them as is in the enciphered text. spaces too; not sure if i have to do anything at all to do that
    d. printf resulting cipher
    e. return 0
